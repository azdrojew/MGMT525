Note:  GKXRep does most of the work, by fitting, training, tuning models.  It stores predictions and realized values in a pkl (perfall.pkl) and 
model complexoty data in a pkl (comp.pkl).  GKXSummary then takes these pkl files and performs the analysis.

GKXSummary.pdf is the output of the script, and GKXSummary.ipynb is the script itself (as a jupyter notebook). GKXSummary.tex is the latex script generated by GKXSummary.ipynb to present the output.
